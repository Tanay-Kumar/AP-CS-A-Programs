    <h1>We Help To Get Solutions</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Notefy, the go-to platform for free, high-quality school 
        notes aimed at enriching students' academic journeys. Our mission is 
        to foster a deeper understanding and reinforce knowledge across various 
        subjects, ensuring students are well-prepared for their tests. While we 
        pride ourselves on creating a collaborative, community-driven environment 
        for sharing educational resources, we strictly do not condone copying 
        homework or posting tests. EduNotes is dedicated to supporting students 
        in studying and revising responsibly, emphasizing the importance of 
        academic integrity and hard work. Contact us if you have any questions 
        or concerns.</p>
